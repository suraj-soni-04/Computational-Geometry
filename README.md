# Computational-Geometry

This project contains implementations of various computational geometry algorithms. Below is an overview of the project structure:

## Project Structure

### Folders

1. **headers**: This folder contains header files for classes and functions used in the project. These headers provide declarations for various geometric entities and operations.

<hr>


2. **src**: The source folder contains the implementation files corresponding to the header files in the `headers` folder. It includes the definitions of classes and functions for performing geometric computations.

*GeomVector.cpp:*

1. **Constructor and Destructor**:
   - Defines constructors for creating geometric vectors with specified coordinates and a default constructor.
   - Includes a destructor, although it's not needed in this case as there are no dynamically allocated resources.

2. **Equality Operator**:
   - Overloads the equality operator (`==`) to check if two vectors are equal by comparing their x, y, and z coordinates.

3. **Vector Operations**:
   - Provides methods to perform vector operations such as dot product, cross product, magnitude calculation, and normalization.
   - Overloads arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to support addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and scalar division of vectors.
   - Includes methods for setting the length of a vector, adding/subtracting scalar values, and multiplying/dividing by a scalar.

4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculates the distance between two vectors and the distance between a vector and a plane.

5. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Computes the angle between two vectors and the angle between a vector and a plane.

6. **Direction Cosines**:
   - Calculates the direction cosines of a vector.

7. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Performs vector-matrix multiplication.

8. **Projection**:
   - Projects a vector onto another vector and projects a vector onto a plane.

3. **output**: This folder is intended to store any output generated by the program. For example, if the program writes results to files, those files would be stored here.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Compile the source files.
4. Run the executable(main.cpp) generated after compilation.
5. `g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -I .\headers -L .\src -l lib`
